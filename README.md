A collection of my configurations from across Linux and Windows, put into a single repo.

## Contributions, inspirations and links alike:
(Foreword:)
> A lot of the configurations that I nowdays use are either partially written or fully so, since sometimes, you don't want to learn how to code in Lua to configure WezTerm or Neovim for your daily drive, and as such, I've optimistically copied others in hopes that at some point I might edit their configurations to my likings, extending upon what has already been made. As such, proper attributions at the very least will be noted:

- [Chris Titus Tech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/neovim) - Neovim configuration file, neovim.startup
- [Michael Williams](https://github.com/m1chaelwilliams) - Making Windows look pretty, WezTerm and GlazeWM
